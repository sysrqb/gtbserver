In no particular order:

- HTTP status interface and administrative control
  - Either third-party lib or custom-written linkable lib
- autoconf setup
- Configuration file instead of macros
- Write unit tests
- Add event-driven request handling implementation
  - either select-based or poll-based will work, but select is preferred
